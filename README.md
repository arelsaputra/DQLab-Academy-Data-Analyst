# Summary of Learning Sessions

## **Session 1: Introduction to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Database** 
In Session 1, we begin our learning journey by getting to know Google Cloud Platform (GCP), one of the world's leading cloud computing platforms, as well as understanding the basic concepts of Database and its role in data management. This material is designed to provide an initial understanding of cloud services and how databases function as a key component in information systems.

## **Session 2: Introduction to SQL, DDL, DML, and Query SELECT** 
In Session 2, we learn the basics of SQL (Structured Query Language), the language used to manage and manipulate data in a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). This material covers important concepts such as DDL (Data Definition Language), DML (Data Manipulation Language), and the use of Query SELECT to retrieve data from a database.

## **Session 3: Query WHERE, SORT, Aggregation, and HAVING**
In Session 3, we delve deeper into using SQL queries for filtering, sorting, data aggregation, and filtering aggregation results. This material will help you understand how to retrieve and analyze data more effectively using more complex SQL commands.

## **Session 4: Sub-Query and CTE**
In Session 4, we explore the use of Sub-Query and Common Table Expressions (CTE) to enhance SQL queries. This material will help you understand how to break down complex queries, improve readability, and optimize data retrieval by using nested queries and temporary result sets efficiently. 

## **Session 5: Advanced SQL Concepts and Data Operations**
In Session 5, we expand our understanding of SQL by covering advanced topics, including:

Using PREFIX in SQL Queries to improve query readability and organization.
Deep Dive into JOIN Operations (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN) for combining data from multiple tables.
Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for effective database modeling and structuring relationships between tables.
Comprehensive Data Operations, including:
Numerical Operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.).
Mathematical Functions (sqrt, pow, ceil, floor, etc.).
Date Operations (date conversion, time differences, extracting year/month/day, etc.).
This session provides hands-on examples, queries, and diagrams to reinforce key database concepts and improve SQL proficiency.
